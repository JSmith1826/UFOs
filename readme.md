# UFOs

## Overview
In this excercise we coded a responsive web page to filter a database of UFO sightings. The data we were given was organized as an array


## Results



## Summary

One thing that I don't love about the usability of the filter is that it relys on the user input being typed pricisly to return results. I would like if the user could select the filter values from a dropdown list instead of needing to type them in. 

It would be impractical to select a date from a dropdown so I would like that element to be populated by a selection method similar to the one pictured below.

I also think that an filter that could be used to search for text within the comments field of the data.
